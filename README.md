## SMART Dataset
We use Alibaba's [Large-scale SSD Failure Prediction Dataset](https://tianchi.aliyun.com/dataset/dataDetail?dataId=95044) [1] as our SMART dataset. We only use Triple Level Cell (TLC) data in this dataset, which corresponds to SSD models MC1 and MC2.

|  | number of good SSD | number of bad SSD |
| --- | --- | --- |
| MC1 | 189147 | 10508 |
| MC2 | 22672 | 1131 |

The procedure for SMART data preprocessing is explained in [smart-preprocess/README.md]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/README.md).
The final output files of preprocessing are under [smart-preprocess/npy](https://github.com/YunfeiGu/APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/npy). We notice that the number of MC2 is too small, and therefore we only use the following files:
- [smart-preprocess/npy/partial_statistics_mc1_model1.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/npy/partial_statistics_mc1_model1.npy)
- [smart-preprocess/npy/partial_statistics_mc1_model2.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/npy/partial_statistics_mc1_model2.npy)
- [smart-preprocess/npy/bad_mc1_model1.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/npy/bad_mc1_model1.npy)
- [smart-preprocess/npy/bad_mc1_model2.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/smart-preprocess/npy/bad_mc1_model2.npy)

## SSD Aging BEC Dataset
The SSD aging BEC Dataset is composed of the following files:
- [BEC_aging_data/aging.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/BEC_aging_data/aging.npy): contains 2048 aging time series. Please refer to our paper for detailed explanation on SSD aging BEC data, aging time series, and the process for SSD aging BEC data preprocessing.
- [badLoop7_4_45.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/BEC_aging_data/badLoop7_4_45.npy) and [goodLoop7_4_45.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/BEC_aging_data/goodLoop7_4_45.npy): contains the open-source normalized SSD aging BEC data over 20,000 SSD drives. These data are LUN fine-grained. This type of dataset represents the SSD wear-out degree corresponding to different P/E cycles. Since the SSD manufacturer NDA protocol, we open-source dataset corresponding to several certain P/E cycles. 

We hope that the released SSD Aging BEC Dataset will enable future studies to quantify the real-world SSD failure prediction research.

## Dataset Prepare
- This step is optional since all datasets used for machine learning models' training and testing process are already well-prepared and saved in [APSNet/data](https://github.com/YunfeiGu/APSNet/tree/main/data). 
- Due to the Intellectual Property policy of the Raw SSD BEC aging data, we only provide the normalized and well-processed SSD BEC aging data in [APSNet/data/aging.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/aging.npy).
- you can run the following scripts to execute all steps for preparing the SMART training and testing dataset: 

```shell
cd ./smart-preprocess
bash smart-preprocess.sh
cd ..
python3 slidingWindow.py
```
Note: while running silidingWindow.py, it will notify that 'Please input the length of days lookahead in range [3, 120]:'. In our experiment, we set N to 5, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120.  After settling down the N value, it will generate the SMART training and testing dataset for evaluating learning models N_days_lookahead prediction performance.

In [/APSNet/data]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data), there are one npy file named aging.npy and 8 subfolders. [aging.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/aging.npy) is the SSD Aging BEC Dataset we proposed and collected. It is the dataset that needs to be fed in the sub-network 2.1b of APSNet. In each subfolder, there is an SSD SMART dataset that needs to be fed in the sub-network 2.1a of APSNet and other baseline models including RF, SVM, LR, DT, KNN, NN, and LSTM. (To understand the APSNet network structure and how these two types of dataset feed-in APSNet, please check Figure 8, Section III-B and III-C in our paper). 

These SMART datasets in each subfolder have been processed by [APSNet/slidingWindow.py]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/slidingWindow.py) already, in order to train and test all learning models for evaluating N days lookahead failure prediction performance.

For example, if you want to evaluate the learning models failure prediction performance in 5 days ahead on all metrics, you have to check out the following dataset: 

- [APSNet/data/aging.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/aging.npy): Processed SSD Aging BEC Dataset. It is used by the sub-network 2.1b of APSNet.
- [APSNet/data/5_days_lookahead/smart_train.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/5_days_lookahead/smart_train.npy): Processed SMART dataset used for all learning model training on SSD failure prediction in 5 days ahead. 
- [APSNet/data/5_days_lookahead/test_labels.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/5_days_lookahead/test_labels.npy): Labels of aforementioned SMART traininig dataset.
- [APSNet/data/5_days_lookahead/smart_test.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/smart_test.npy): Processed SMART dataset used for all learning model testing on SSD failure prediction in 5 days ahead. 
- [APSNet/data/5_days_lookahead/test_labels.npy]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/data/test_labels.npy): Labels of aforementioned SMART testing dataset.
## Instructions on Experiment using the Local Environment

### Initial Setup

First install the experimental environment with our [environment.yml](environment.yml):

```shell
conda env create -f environment.yml --name apsnet
```

Then activate the experimental environment:

```shell
conda activate apsnet
```
### Model Training
This step is also optional because all models have been well-trained and saved in [APSNet/trained_model]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/trained_model). The proposed key algorithm is APSNet. In the source code structure, APSNet contains two parts. One is Pnet which is the Pseudo Siamese Network in this network, the other one is RF which is used for RF-based adaptive discriminator. In Exp\#1, the baseline algorithms are RF, DT, LR, KNN, NN, LSTM, SVM. In Exp#2, the compared methods are the APSNet
with alternatives of sub-networks 2.a and 2.b, called APSNet_LL, APSNet_GG, and APSNet_GL respectively (Please check the Table XI in Section IV of our paper). In Exp\#3, the baseline is the APSNet without RF-based adaptive discriminator, called APSNet_NRF (Please check the Exp#3 in Section IV of our paper). The train source code of each model has been involved in [APSNet/main/model_src](https://github.com/YunfeiGu/APSNet/tree/main/model_src). Please read [APSNet/main/model_src/README.md](https://github.com/YunfeiGu/APSNet/tree/main/model_src/README.md) to understand how each learning model corresponds to each python file.

The commands for each machine learning model training:
```shell
cd ./model_src
```
- Train RF: 
```shell
python3 rf.py
```
- Train SVM: 
```shell
python3 svm.py
```
- Train DT: 
```shell
python3 dt.py
```
- Train KNN: 
```shell
python3 knn.py
```
- Train LR: 
```shell
python3 lr.py
```
- Train LSTM: 
```shell
python3 lstm.py
```
- Train NN: 
```shell
python3 nn.py
```
- Train PNet:
```shell
python3 pnet.py
```
- Train PNet_LL:
```shell
python3 pnet_2lstm.py
```
- Train PNet_GL:
```shell
python3 pnet_gru_lstm.py
```
- Train PNet_GG:
```shell
python3 pnet_2gru.py
```
Note: While running each model training script, it will notify that 'Please input the length of N days lookahead in the range [3, 120]:'. In our experiment, we set N to 5, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120.  After settling down the N value, the training of the corresponding learning model will be trained and the well-trained model will be saved in the corresponding subfolder. 

For example, if you want to train the RF learning model for evaluating the performance on 5 days lookahead SSD failure prediction, input 5 and the well-trained RF learning model will be saved as [rf.pkl]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/trained_model/5_days_lookahead/rf.pkl) in subfolder [APSNet/trained_model/5_days_lookahead]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/trained_model/5_days_lookahead).

In each subfolder, there are 11 well-trained learning models:

- dt.pkl: well-trained decision tree learning model.
- knn.pkl: well-trained K-nearest neighbor learning model.
- lr.pkl: well-trained linear regression learning model.
- rf.pkl: well-trained random forest learning model.
- svm.pkl: well-trained support vector machine model.
- model_lstm_final.pkl: well-trained long-short term memory network learning model.
- model_nn_final.pkl: well-trained neural network model.
- model_pnet_final.pkl:well-trained proposed pseudo siamese network learning model.
- pnet_2gru.pkl: well-trained proposed pseudo siamese network with the alternative sub-networks. Both sub-netowrk 2.a and 2.b are GRU networks (explained in Section IV and Table XI of our paper).
- pnet_2lstm.pkl: well-trained proposed pseudo siamese network with the alternative sub-networks. Both sub-network 2.a and 2.b are LSTM network.
- pnet_gru_lstm.pkl: well-trained proposed pseudo siamese network with the alternative sub-networks. sub-netowrk 2.a is GRU, sub-network 2.b is LSTM.

### Model Testing and Reproducing Experiment Results

To reproduce all experiment results, we provide the jupyter notebook scripts to evaluate the failure prediction performance on all metrics in various days lookahead. Please read the check-list artifact check-list in Section~\ref{sec:check-list} and model testing instruction in the [APSNet/README.md]( https://github.com/SJTU-Storage-Lab/SC2023AE_APSNet/tree/main/README.md) file. 
Note: While running each model testing script, it will notify that 'Please input the length of N days lookahead in the range [3, 120]:'. In our experiment, we set N to 5, 7, 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120. After settling down the N value, the testing of the corresponding learning model will start and finally print the result of each metric in N days lookahead failure prediction. 
Use jupyter notebook to open each script and run. For example:
```shell
cd APSNet/
jupyter notebook --no-browser --port=8001
```
Use your local browser to open http://server\_ip:8001/
Then click 'RUN', and it will run the model testing and print all metrics' results
